# Who's that Pokemon

## Requirements
install the requirements with:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Download the dataset
The current dataset used is the LFW and can be download from [LFW-People](https://www.kaggle.com/atulanandjha/lfwpeople)

- The dataset can be automatically downloaded with the command `dataset_download_targz()` as shown in the `data_visualization` notebook.

## Dataset data module
The Data Module takes in input a dataset and generates training,validation and test set. 
Currently the Data Module uses an image transformation that aligns the faces using an affine transformation. 
This can be changed inside `lfw_lightning_data_module` changing the default `FaceAlignTransform(FaceAlignTransform.ROTATION)` to `FaceAlignTransform(FaceAlignTransform.AFFINE)` in order to have the experimental affine transformation. 

## Image storage service
The image storage service belongs to his own module under image-registration-service.
Before starting the service is mandatory to configure the credentials in the `credentials.py` file. The credentials for the database are shared in private among the team members. 
Is possible to start up the service typing `python entry.py` inside the module folder.

This service exposes a very simple REST API with 3 methods:

- POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/store/<int:employee_id>
	- take as input a JSON of the image data as following:
```
{
	"name":"giovanni",
	"surname":"bartolomeo",
	"img_features":[int], 
	"img_base64":"base64 encoded image"
}
``` 
if the image features are already available is possible to populate the **img_features** int vector, otherwise sending the base64 encoded image, through the **img_base64** string field, the serivce will extract the features on his own and store them on the db. <br>
ðŸ”º**The img_base64 feature extraction is not yet implemented, populating this field will lead to a failure**ðŸ”º
- GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/get_all/<page_size>/<page_number>
	- If for example we want to get the first batch of 10 elements from the image list we call `api/get_all/10/1`
	- For the second batch of 10 elements we type `api/get_all/10/2`
- DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/<employee_id> to delete an entry from the db using the id
